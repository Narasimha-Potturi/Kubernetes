### The Challenge

When running a Kubernetes application in a Minikube cluster inside WSL, the application is not directly accessible from a browser on the host Windows machine. While the service can be reached using `curl` from within the WSL terminal, standard `localhost` access from Windows fails. This is due to the multiple layers of network virtualization between the Windows host, the WSL environment, and the Minikube cluster's internal network.

### The Solution: An Interactive Explainer

Instead of a static text document, this project presents the solution as a single-page interactive application. The goal is to make these complex networking concepts intuitive and easy to grasp for developers of all levels.

**Key Features:**
* **Interactive Problem Diagram:** Clickable components that visually explain the different network layers.
* **Solution Comparison Cards:** A clear, side-by-side view of the `kubectl port-forward` and `minikube service` commands.
* **Dynamic Recommendation Chart:** A visual data chart that compares the two solutions against professional DevOps metrics.
* **Fully Responsive Design:** A clean, modern UI that works on desktop and mobile devices.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **HTML5**
* **Tailwind CSS** for styling and layout.
* **Vanilla JavaScript** for all interactivity and logic.
* **Chart.js** for the dynamic comparison chart.
